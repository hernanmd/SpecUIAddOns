# Usage

It requires you already have some experience building Spec user-interfaces. Most widgets can be used by composition (i.e.: in the #instantiateModels: inside your #initializeWidgets). Some other widgets are intended to be subclassed.

# Usage notes

  - The SpecUIAddOns classes begins with Spc prefix.
  - Most widgets implements example methods in the class side, category "examples"
